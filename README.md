# Intelligent Traffic Scene Analysis for Real-World Driving

## Abstract

This project develops an intelligent computer vision system for real-world driving scenarios, combining crash event classification and road surface analysis. Using deep learning techniques such as CNNs and transfer learning, the system automatically detects traffic accidents and categorizes road surface conditions to support safety, monitoring, and decision-making applications.
